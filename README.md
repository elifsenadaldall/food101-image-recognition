# Food101 Image Classification and Insight Generation

This project implements a deep learning-based food image classifier using the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/). It leverages a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model to classify food images into 101 categories and uses Grad-CAM for model interpretability. A lightweight user interface was created with Streamlit, enhanced by Google Gemini API integration for nutritional insights.
